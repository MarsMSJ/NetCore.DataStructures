# .NET Core 2.0 Data Structures : Tree Structures

This folder contains general node structures for just about any tree out there. They all inherit from the base ITreeNode<T> interface. You'll notice in the base interface, the "Parent" field is defined. The parent field is optional.

## Tree Node Structures
* BinaryTreeNode<T>
* RedBlackTreeNode<T>
* TernaryTreeNode<T>
* N_aryTreeNode<T> 

## Tree Data Structure
* BST<T>
